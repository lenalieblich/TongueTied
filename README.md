This repository stores a 3D VR college project (made with Unity 3D) for google cardboard. In this game you play a girl that finds herself on a pirate ship. The only way for her to communicate with the pirates surrounding her is by nodding or shaking her head. Listen to the pirates' stories and answer their questions in order to survive the adventure.
Our Google Cardboard VR Project for the class Human Computer Interaction.
